# Sinatra To Rails Pick 1 Of 3 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Pick one of the following three Sinatra-based challenges and build it in Rails:

1. [Craigslist, Jr.](/challenges/275)
2. [Sinatra URL Shortener](/challenges/276)
3. [Hacker News Clone](/challenges/301)

Focus first and foremost on doing things the "Rails way."  Rails' idiomatic style can be frustrating coming from simpler, more explicit frameworks like Sinatra, but the sooner you [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) how Rails sees the world the more productive you'll be.

## Objectives

If you need a specific area to focus on, [Rails form helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html) are a great place to start.  Form helpers are the collection of view helpers that Rails uses to generate, manipulate, and submit forms.
